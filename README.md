# Palindrome-Checker
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled the same backwards as it is forwards. This program takes an array of string words, reverses them using StringBuilder and checks the reversed words against the normal ones case insensitively. If a palindrome match is discovered the counter goes up one.
